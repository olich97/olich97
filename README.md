### Hi there Brates! 👋

I'm Oleh (friends call me Olich) 👱 <br>
I'm from [Ukraine](https://goo.gl/maps/TNhdrpgGgsRaUbJy7) 🇺🇦 <br>
I've been living in [Italy](https://goo.gl/maps/LjJxzanHLYo7A1TQA) since 2010  🇮🇹 <br>

🧙 I'm a very curious software developer, while coding I feel like a magician, a bricklayer, a painter and a superhero at the same time 🦸‍♂️
